# Best Practices for Handling Large Data Files in Python

## Overview

Working with large datasets (100s of GB) in Python requires careful consideration of memory management, processing strategies, and tool selection. This guide covers proven techniques and libraries for efficiently handling big data without running into memory limitations.

## Memory Management Fundamentals

### Understanding Memory Constraints
- Python loads data into RAM by default
- Large files can exceed available memory, causing crashes
- Monitor memory usage with tools like `memory_profiler` or `psutil`
- Consider your system's RAM capacity when planning data processing

### Lazy Loading Strategies
- Load only what you need, when you need it
- Use generators and iterators instead of loading entire datasets
- Implement streaming approaches for continuous data processing

## Core Libraries and Tools

### Pandas with Chunking
```python
# Read large CSV files in chunks
chunk_size = 10000
for chunk in pd.read_csv('large_file.csv', chunksize=chunk_size):
    # Process each chunk
    processed_chunk = chunk.groupby('column').sum()
    # Save or accumulate results
```

### Dask for Parallel Processing
```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

# Dask creates a task graph without loading data
df = dd.read_csv('large_file.csv')
result = df.groupby('column').sum().compute()
```
Dask is primarily used to scale pandas computations beyond a single machine or memory. It provides a pandas-like API but enables distributed computing, making it possible to process data that doesn't fit into RAM or that needs to be split across a cluster.

### Polars for High Performance
```python
import polars as pl

# Polars is optimized for large datasets
df = pl.read_csv('large_file.csv')
result = df.group_by('column').agg(pl.sum('value'))
```
#### Top 5 Pros of Polars vs. Pandas

- **Significantly Faster Performance:** Polars can be 5–100 times faster for key data operations, especially with large datasets and complex transformations.
- **Efficient Memory Usage:** Polars typically uses less RAM, enabling the handling of data sets much larger than what pandas can process on the same hardware.
- **Multi-core Utilization:** Polars is designed to leverage all CPU cores by default, granting even more speed advantages through true parallel processing.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Studies show Polars consumes less energy, making it ideal for both eco-conscious and resource-constrained environments.
- **Lazy Evaluation Support:** Polars offers lazy evaluation for query optimization, resulting in reduced computation time for complex pipelines.

For the majority of in-memory workloads and many chunked or streaming workloads, Polars’ built-in parallelism means you don’t need Dask.

## File Format Optimization

### Parquet Format
- Columnar storage format
- Excellent compression ratios
- Fast read/write operations
- Built-in schema evolution

```python
# Convert CSV to Parquet for better performance
df = pd.read_csv('large_file.csv')
df.to_parquet('large_file.parquet', compression='snappy')

# Read Parquet with column selection
df = pd.read_parquet('large_file.parquet', columns=['col1', 'col2'])
```

You can both read from and write to Parquet format directly in Polars. This includes loading one or many Parquet files (as a single table or “dataset”) and writing efficient Parquet outputs after processing your data. Parquet is a columnar format, and Polars’ in-memory structure is also column-oriented, allowing for extremely fast data loading and saving

```python
import polars as pl
df.write_parquet("output.parquet")
df = pl.read_parquet("datafile.parquet")
```

## Processing Strategies

### Chunked Processing Pattern
```python
def process_large_file(filename, chunk_size=10000):
    results = []
    
    for chunk in pd.read_csv(filename, chunksize=chunk_size):
        # Apply transformations
        processed = chunk.apply(some_function)
        
        # Aggregate or filter
        summary = processed.groupby('key').agg({'value': 'sum'})
        results.append(summary)
    
    # Combine all results
    final_result = pd.concat(results).groupby(level=0).sum()
    return final_result
```

### Streaming with Generators
```python
def read_large_file_streaming(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            yield process_line(line)

# Memory-efficient processing
for processed_line in read_large_file_streaming('huge_file.txt'):
    # Handle one line at a time
    handle_result(processed_line)
```

## Database Integration

### SQLite for Local Analysis
```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

# Load data into SQLite for SQL-based analysis
conn = sqlite3.connect('data.db')
df.to_sql('large_table', conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)

# Query subsets efficiently
result = pd.read_sql_query(
    "SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE condition = 'value'", 
    conn
)
```

### PostgreSQL for Production
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db')

# Use copy_from for fast bulk inserts
df.to_sql('table_name', engine, if_exists='append', 
          index=False, method='multi')
```

## Memory Monitoring and Optimization

### Profile Memory Usage
```python
from memory_profiler import profile

@profile
def memory_intensive_function():
    # Your data processing code
    pass

# Run with: python -m memory_profiler script.py
```

### Optimize Data Types
```python
# Reduce memory usage by optimizing dtypes
def optimize_dtypes(df):
    for col in df.columns:
        if df[col].dtype == 'int64':
            if df[col].min() >= 0:
                if df[col].max() < 255:
                    df[col] = df[col].astype('uint8')
                elif df[col].max() < 65535:
                    df[col] = df[col].astype('uint16')
        elif df[col].dtype == 'float64':
            df[col] = df[col].astype('float32')
    return df
```

## Parallel Processing Approaches

### Multiprocessing for CPU-bound Tasks
```python
from multiprocessing import Pool
import numpy as np

def process_chunk(chunk):
    # CPU-intensive processing
    return chunk.apply(complex_calculation)

# Split data and process in parallel
chunks = np.array_split(df, 4)
with Pool(processes=4) as pool:
    results = pool.map(process_chunk, chunks)

final_result = pd.concat(results)
```

### Joblib for Scikit-learn Integration
```python
from joblib import Parallel, delayed

def process_partition(partition):
    return partition.groupby('key').sum()

# Parallel processing with joblib
results = Parallel(n_jobs=-1)(
    delayed(process_partition)(chunk) 
    for chunk in chunks
)
```

## Performance Optimization Tips

### I/O Optimization
- Use SSD storage for better read/write performance
- Consider network-attached storage for very large datasets
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Use compression to reduce I/O overhead

### Algorithm Selection
- Choose algorithms with lower memory complexity
- Use approximate algorithms when exact results aren't required
- Implement early stopping conditions to avoid unnecessary computation
- Consider sampling techniques for exploratory analysis

### System Configuration
```python
# Increase pandas display options for large datasets
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 100)

# Configure matplotlib for memory efficiency
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')  # Non-interactive backend
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Robust File Processing
```python
def robust_chunk_processor(filename, chunk_size=10000):
    processed_chunks = 0
    failed_chunks = []
    
    try:
        for i, chunk in enumerate(pd.read_csv(filename, chunksize=chunk_size)):
            try:
                result = process_chunk(chunk)
                save_chunk_result(result, i)
                processed_chunks += 1
            except Exception as e:
                failed_chunks.append((i, str(e)))
                continue
                
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Critical error: {e}")
        return None
    
    return {
        'processed': processed_chunks,
        'failed': failed_chunks
    }
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### Progress Tracking
```python
from tqdm import tqdm
import logging

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def process_with_progress(filename, chunk_size=10000):
    # Get total number of chunks
    total_rows = sum(1 for _ in open(filename)) - 1  # Subtract header
    total_chunks = (total_rows // chunk_size) + 1
    
    with tqdm(total=total_chunks, desc="Processing chunks") as pbar:
        for i, chunk in enumerate(pd.read_csv(filename, chunksize=chunk_size)):
            try:
                process_chunk(chunk)
                logger.info(f"Processed chunk {i+1}/{total_chunks}")
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Failed to process chunk {i+1}: {e}")
            finally:
                pbar.update(1)
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Start Small**: Test your processing pipeline on a subset before scaling
2. **Profile First**: Identify bottlenecks before optimizing
3. **Choose the Right Tool**: Match the tool to your specific use case
4. **Monitor Resources**: Keep track of memory and CPU usage
5. **Plan for Failures**: Implement robust error handling and recovery
6. **Document Everything**: Keep track of processing steps and parameters
7. **Version Control Data**: Use tools like DVC for large dataset versioning
8. **Test Incrementally**: Validate results at each processing stage

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Loading entire datasets into memory without checking size
- Using inefficient file formats (CSV vs Parquet)
- Not optimizing data types
