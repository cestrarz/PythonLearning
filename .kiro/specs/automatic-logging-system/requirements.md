# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides an automatic logging utility that captures commands executed in Python scripts and their corresponding outputs. The system should be extremely simple to integrate - requiring only a single function call to enable comprehensive logging of script execution flow and results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically log all commands and their outputs in my Python scripts, so that I can track execution flow and debug issues without manually adding print statements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user calls `start_logging(log_file="", log_dir="")` THEN the system SHALL automatically capture all subsequent command executions and outputs
2. WHEN the logging is active THEN the system SHALL log both the command being executed and its output
3. WHEN a log_file parameter is provided THEN the system SHALL write logs to that specific file
4. WHEN a log_dir parameter is provided THEN the system SHALL create log files in that directory
5. IF no parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults for log file location

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the logging to work transparently with my existing code, so that I don't need to modify my script logic or add manual logging statements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL capture outputs without interfering with normal script execution
2. WHEN the script uses print statements THEN the system SHALL log those outputs while still displaying them normally
3. WHEN the script executes functions that return values THEN the system SHALL log both function calls and return values
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error information along with the command that caused it

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the log format to be clear and readable, so that I can easily understand the execution flow when reviewing logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commands are logged THEN the system SHALL include timestamps for each entry
2. WHEN logging outputs THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between commands and their outputs
3. WHEN multiple commands execute THEN the system SHALL maintain chronological order in the log
4. WHEN the log file is viewed THEN the format SHALL be human-readable and well-structured

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the logging system to handle different types of Python operations, so that I get comprehensive coverage of my script's behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script contains function calls THEN the system SHALL log function names and parameters
2. WHEN the script contains variable assignments THEN the system SHALL log the assignment operations
3. WHEN the script contains loops or conditionals THEN the system SHALL log the control flow execution
4. WHEN the script imports modules or executes external commands THEN the system SHALL log these operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the logging to be performant and not significantly slow down my scripts, so that I can use it in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging is active THEN the system SHALL minimize performance overhead
2. WHEN writing to log files THEN the system SHALL use efficient I/O operations
3. WHEN capturing outputs THEN the system SHALL not cause memory leaks or excessive memory usage
4. IF logging fails THEN the system SHALL not crash the main script execution
